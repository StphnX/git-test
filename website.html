            <h3>REMOVE PLANT FOODS</h3>
            <p>While it seems simple on the face of it: eat <br>
                meat, there are some nuances to overcome <br>
                which can vary person to person. That's where <br>
                we can help.</p>

        <div id="floater-middle">
            <h3>FIX YOUR BODY & MIND</h3>
            <p>With plant foods and potentially high levels of <br>
                carbohydrates out of the way, we can reset <br>
                your body and metabolism to create a newer <br>
                stronger foundation.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="floater-right">
            <h3>ADD PLANT FOODS BACK IN (MAYBE)</h3>
            <p>Using a carb free and plant free foundation,<br>
                plus control of your new healthy body, you <br>
                might want to consider adding some plant <br>
                foods back in and we support that.</p>
